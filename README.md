# 💵LOAN STATUS PREDICTION 💵

This is a Flask-based machine learning web application that predicts whether a loan will be **Approved ✅** or **Rejected ❌** based on user input.


## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses a logistic regression model trained on a dataset of loan applicants to predict loan approval status. The web interface allows users to input details such as income, credit history, and education to get instant predictions.
